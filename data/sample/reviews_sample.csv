21148947,1277682205808252403,2024-10-28,590287279,Dylan,"The place was not cleaned before our arrival. The owner and host were very apologetic and sent a maid service immediately and waived the cleaning fee. Upon our arrival I did not hear from the host about the door code to get inside. Had to wait a little bit before the owner showed up and the door code was given. Normally I feel like we should have that info before arriving. Other than the arrival issue and the cleaning issue, the host and owner were very nice and accommodating. The house was perfect for what we needed it for."
29302404,1383459793796145354,2025-03-23,2693671,Maria,"We had a great 2-night stay at this place. For those worrying about privacy, the top floor has 3 rooms: bedroom, living space and bathroom; all three have doors; additionally, the staircase is designed so that no one can see anything at the top unless they come up. Noise carries, of course, it's someone's house, but the hosts are conscious of that and it was quiet by 10 or so. The area itself is very quiet, a nice getaway from the noise of downtown. A cool bar/restaurant around the corner and 2-3 min drive to some excellent cafes (try freeweeling' coffee!). For us, the price is worth the location and quiet. Comfy bed with extra pillows, great shower."
202187,1512782,2012-06-18,2639500,Cynthia,"This apartment is super cute and is in a great location right next to south congress.  walking distance to shopping and food trucks!  The reason i give it 4 stars is that the bed was quite uncomfortable.  My boyfriend and i both tossed and turned and woke up sore.  Other than that the amenities are nice, small fridge, and microwave and basic dishes if you just want to stay in for the night and hang out.  Neighborhood is also really quiet!  that was great!"
12308357,705033892043041343,2022-08-30,239117824,Miles,"My stay at Bill's was unlike any other! From the cheerful and upbeat decorum of the host to the amazing room, I was very impressed. The feel of the space was like a 5 star hotel suite, complete with an incredible en suite. As soon as we entered the space my girlfriend and I both agreed that we will be back again 😁. Thanks again Bill for an amazing stay!"
23038138,1121854186430551248,2024-03-27,33829391,Brian,"The place was very clean and well done, super comfy!  Will definitely stay again!"
57187,489916371,2019-07-17,254327831,Victoria,"Had a wonderful time with friends. It’s comfy, colorful, and very close to fun!"
15942648,155670738,2017-05-28,15315089,Roberto,"Nancy was very thorough throughout the process, from confirmation to check out. The apartment was very clean and well stocked and in a great area of Austin. It is very close to a supermarket, bakery and liquor store and you can reach downtown on foot.<br/>We could sometimes hear the upstairs neighbor, but this is to be expected in a city apartment.<br/>Overall, our experience was wonderful and the property was exactly as described."
1462311,151018622,2017-05-10,113300210,Kait,Highly recommend!  Great location for restaurants & shopping.  Chris is an engaged host and took the time to make us feel more than welcome and had great suggestions for places to check out during our stay :-) 
29302404,993596888894124943,2023-10-02,11771452,Erica,Had everything we needed in a perfect location. Very accommodating hosts!
23038138,877525037449507971,2023-04-25,473021855,Katelyn,Such a perfect place to stay in Austin! Super spacious with great amenities!
852247306479211711,1469766758406697659,2025-07-20,270578502,Ashley,"Great area with lots of things to do. Very spacious backyard and comfortable rooms. Only issue was that some of utilities wouldn’t work like the main bedroom fan and a doorknob coming undone. Other than that, great place and would recommend! I do wish more bath towel were provided."
23468465,1284269245070213227,2024-11-06,207535538,Alfredo,It was a delightful staying. I wish I could have stayed a couple of days more to relax and enjoy the cozy little house! I’ll definitely try to stay again in my next opportunity. My wife loved the stay too. Kenny and Whiskey the cat were amazing hosts. 5 stars! ⭐️
782618337171518178,886299437964090591,2023-05-07,425587370,Jm,Good option and location for UT busy weekends!
705858,1358848900482875949,2025-02-17,359921363,Yuri,Bill was kind and communicative before the stay and throughout the stay! The location is walkable to South Congress and many restaurants. The private hot tub is so nice!
28379054,800089686806473688,2023-01-08,490099606,Amir,place looked just like the pictures! Will recommend to our friends when visiting austin. Thanks for making our austin trip amazing!!
10042925,493552789,2019-07-22,144696371,Arely,"Jennifer had everything ready for us, she let us know ahead of time the construction issues, and she had plenty of amenities for us to use. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. We had a great time!"
16338748,960155064387023427,2023-08-17,439679555,Russell,Great stay!
15886011,1074063479606744970,2024-01-21,1287834,Tonia,I stayed overnight here with some friends to run a local race (was close to the finish line).  The condo was comfortable and clean.  We did note one of the beds was broken so we had to adjusted our sleeping arrangements but it was not a big deal. There is some noise from the streets nearby which may be bothersome for light sleepers.
15886011,764891216,2021-05-31,51999980,Cristina,"This has been one of my favorite places to stay. Hanging out on the balcony was fun. The location is everything. Just a heads up, there are no mirrors in any of the rooms, only in the restrooms and that made it a challenge for the ladies to get ready, besides that everything was great!"
1285142090397458255,1364665294591477997,2025-02-25,189538999,Cody,"Great location, and clean! Highly recommend!"
202187,360467063,2018-12-20,842786,Jinesh,"John's apartment was charming. Conveniently located, cozy, and clean. John was easy to reach and very helpful. I enjoyed my time there greatly, and would  recommend highly!"
28640193,737945494,2021-03-10,82286813,Angelika,"This place was perfect for our little four day getaway! It’s conveniently located near some of Austin’s top restaurants and shops, and it’s not far from the airport. If you’re looking for something cute and sweet, this is definitely your top pick!"
202187,241321782,2018-03-08,67330592,Cody,"The Airbnb was nice and close to downtown. I was able to walk the entire stay and the house was located on a quiet street. The internet was very spotty, but John does address this in the house details"
17103933,508255075,2019-08-12,145207029,Jasmine,Great place to stay at!
23468465,1389258372309397660,2025-03-31,17620045,Nicole,Don’t pass up staying here! Property is so cute and I’m already missing the sauna + cold plunge. It’s a really special place and I will absolutely be making this my go-to when I’m in Austin.
1343435259472252397,1393637605932689536,2025-04-06,54370418,Matthew,"Nice lil cozy space perfect for a couple + pet. There is no real kitchen but I managed fine considering I was there for a short stay. There is a small fenced outdoor space to let dog walk around, which was convenient. Close enough to main attractions to make it worth it."
48867583,768933758,2021-06-11,170277318,Kaylynne,Nice hotel!
5094445,189729781,2017-09-02,141041187,Jenna,"Bill was a fabulous host and has a beautiful space! The pool was amazing! It was a very short, easy walk to lots of cute boutiques and restaurants. I would totally stay with him again!"
1462311,594214081921120633,2022-03-30,70806891,Ethan,You can’t beat this location and space you’ll get for the price. Chris is great at communicating and will give you lots of good recommendations if you need some things to do.
12308357,1170385058305260927,2024-06-02,438614400,Ren,Great spot for a private post-wedding evening!
5094445,1262420417557179646,2024-10-07,229766529,Cierra,Bill’s Airbnb was the perfect place to relax before and after the Austin City Limits music festival. The place was clean with fun personal touches and the pool was refreshing. I would definitely recommend staying here.
15886011,634060034,2020-07-02,186370561,Morgan,"Nice apartment. Convenient area. The photos however, make you think you’re going into something slightly different. Rules are a little tight, such as taking out your own trash, even after you already pay $100 cleaning fee, then if you don’t take out the trash another $100 on top of that. There was an open, half-used jar of pasta sauce in the cabinet, no forks, Very foul smell in the dishwasher, and dirty showers. There were scuffs on the walls. Also, the front door handle fell off and we ended up needing to fix it ourselves, along with other door handles in the bedrooms being broken. This stay has so much promise with it’s great location, amazing layout and view, and closeness to amenities - but it does need to have these issues fixed beforehand. But, we still had a good time. We had an issue with our toilet, and they fixed it immediately. Would probably stay again, but it just needs to be cleaner."
19789358,403351665,2019-01-20,25894829,Martha,Alfredo and Juliet were wonderful hosts. We felt at home and enjoyed being there! Would highly recommend.
12308357,761559016,2021-05-23,6970285,Cooper,Wonderful location and great place for couples. Bathroom & closet space are much bigger/nicer than expected. Path does have a lot of stairs/gravel so would recommend shoulder bags vs rolling luggage. We didn’t get to use the pool due to rain all weekend but it is beautiful. Bill was great!
12308357,915322469257002665,2023-06-16,3041353,Elissa,I only wish we could have stayed longer! Beautifully designed. We’d love to stay again when we come back to Austin.
349447,445643942,2019-04-29,124576522,Yasin,"Great host, easy check-in, parking right Infront of the door, clean place, good amount of space, everything you need is available right there! Will come back again and recommend highly!"
15942648,158443743,2017-06-06,117103191,Alan,"Nancy was an excellent host.  She made our first airbnb stay perfect.  Her place was well-decorated, clean and had all the right amenities.  The location was very convenient and made access to wonderful downtown Austin so simple.   I would definitely try to stay there again!"
705858,136105249,2017-03-08,31982653,Lisa,"Bill is a fantastic host and his place was great as well.  Loved being able to walk to the coffee shop and even bought myself a pair of boots up the street.  Definitely would stay here again.  Prime location, quiet street."
28640193,565186379162860573,2022-02-18,44914170,Tom,"Was just right for my stay… thanks guys for having me … loved the location and many little places to try. If your wanting to go for a walk, it’s just a few steps away and public transportation is near as well. Love that your place is also down a quite road. You all in town this is a must stay!"
48867583,453535855275512799,2021-09-17,73661606,George,"Awesome location, amazing staff.  Highly recommend!"
49384908,1363158142535670785,2025-02-23,305738231,Ashley,Loved this house and it was very dog friendly! Excited to stay here again on my next visit to Austin!
23038138,987705426147885679,2023-09-24,202083265,Darius,"Great host. This was my second time at the location, will be booking again."
23468465,1120362991617054839,2024-03-25,19258928,Marie,We always love a quirky place and this one fits the bill! Appreciated the chocolate and other touches. Whiskey was so cute and surprisingly friendly. ><<br/>Great place to relax with tons to do just down the street!
1462311,715925835046403915,2022-09-14,188758227,Marcella,"This little farmhouse feeling cottage is a beautiful little gem in urban Austin. Chris was super attentive and was very responsive when communicating. Space was just what we needed for our midweek, mini-vacation. Will definitely stay here again and will recommend it to friends."
5094445,113960467,2016-11-14,97667729,Kathi,"Unfortunately, only had one night to enjoy this home. Everything stated on the website is accurate and it is a very comfortable accommodation.  The location was perfect for us as it was just a few blocks from the path that will take you to Town Lake and the surrounding activities.  "
53413902,937736592056458860,2023-07-17,438631656,Claire,"Really nice place to stay at, great location! Everything was very clean and Jon was SUPER  responsive and helpful!! Would definitely recommend/stay here again!"
626065916690491645,1439262596014785882,2025-06-08,479827953,Ellie,"This house was AWESOME!!! The host was so responsive and so accommodating. The location is quite literally perfect. I was in Austin for my bachelorette party and we were able to walk to EVERYTHING…ice cream, liquor store, coffee, restaurants, bars, Target, Whole Foods. 10/10 recommend"
29302404,442078146,2019-04-22,240528182,Alison,"This Airbnb is extremely well located! The hosts are really friendly, and their home is extremely nice and clean. I would definitely stay there again!"
705858,543538432545239813,2022-01-19,147928975,Brooke,Everything was awesome. From the pool to the location. Great amenities! Would love to stay here again.
23468465,1026940562928465434,2023-11-17,135561605,Amy,"I was left in awe of this charming home! I’ve stayed in countless airbnbs in the past but this is the first that truly felt like a welcoming home. The mix of ambient and natural lighting truly made the place feel cozy. I tried to spend as much time in the cute outdoor patio and porch. The gorgeous garden and greenery almost makes you forget you’re in the city. Despite its central location, quiet hours were respected. Whiskey the friendly cat was another highlight of my stay. Although I came on a work trip, Julie’s place offered so much to help me unwind at the end of the day. I truly hope I get another chance to stay here!"
19789358,852880457261353653,2023-03-22,441209769,Maria Kayleen,Great place! Bedroom and bathroom were spotless and had access to the kitchen as well.
15942648,740595752478666801,2022-10-18,5353321,Daniel,"Great location on the west side of downtown.  Easy walk to a lot of places or a very short scooter, uber/lyft ride anywhere.  Nancy & Vin were very quick to respond to any questions and were great hosts.  There is one temporary compliant, there is construction occurring across the street that starts about 8 am.  Ear plugs provided but if you're a light sleeper it might be an something to think about. Otherwise was a very solid stay!<br/>Better half is fantastic for food/drinks and is 1 block away!"
7859914,473434071,2019-06-21,77385780,Barbara,"The place was cozy, private and in the right location. I love it felt like home away from home."
1003881093066787583,1399402391641868132,2025-04-14,39176796,Doug,We really enjoyed our stay at this house. The location was convenient for visiting The Domain and downtown. Marisa was very attentive and the house was perfect for our group of 5 but could easily have accommodated more.
349447,825419592461701429,2023-02-12,68945211,Melanie,"My boyfriend and I were in Austin for a long weekend to explore the city, visit the university, and catch a longhorns basketball game. We knew we didn’t want to stay in a hotel, so this airbnb close to the UT campus was great. The home was easy to find from the hosts very descriptive instructions, using the keypad to get in was easy, and the home was so cozy and beautifully maintained. It was modern but had a very cool Texas feel. The bed was SO comfortable, and the garage door in the kitchen was an awesome addition, especially for the warmer sunny day during our trip. As for the location; it wasn’t super walkable to downtown/restaurants, especially at night since parts of east Austin aren’t as developed and are kind of sketchy. But there were plenty of lime scooters for us to catch in the neighborhood, and we were shocked at the low prices of Uber, 6 dollars to get downtown at 10pm on a Friday is unheard of in DC (where we are from). We will surely be back! Thanks Jason and Meredith!"
2528473,1020421375887060179,2023-11-08,466290558,Gregory,Great stay and great vibes

594291992666525609,628283430511097507,2022-05-16,375639560,Jamice,"I had a very pleasant stay. The unit was clean, nicely decorated, and fully stocked with all essentials including bottled water in the fridge. Pictures are accurate to the unit. Quiet area and still close to downtown with lots of adventure.A steal for pricing! Would definitely visit again."
2528473,654298268,2020-08-21,192752775,Rosalinda,"Best airbnb I’ve ever stayed at, the backyard is beautiful and i loved all the animals"
23468465,474873038,2019-06-23,145509347,Laura,"Julie and Pete were extremely accommodating when we were in Austin. They added personal touches of putting local Austin beverages in the fridge for our arrival, check-in was easy, and they followed up with us to let us know about the local coffee shop (Figure 8) which had amazing breakfast tacos. The place was the perfect size for 2-3 people, comfortable, and clean!"
23038138,327895382,2018-09-24,129305636,Morgan,Brian’s has a beautiful place it was the perfect spot for a day getaway to enjoy the city! I truly appreciate the cleanliness and simple cute decoration. Location was super close to everything!
1462311,950747116055702326,2023-08-04,178224144,Melina,Chris was a great host and touched base with me the night before my arrival.  He met me at the airbnb and walked me through how the gates/keypads worked.  I was very surprised by this touch and I enjoyed the space.  It was well equipped and felt very comfortable/ very spacious.  I would come here again in a heartbeat.  The parking situation and walkability of the area is unbeatable!
1062432083717763776,1115369129094992573,2024-03-18,2335965,Nena Margaret,"Comfortable, well-appointed, stylish and with easy access to downtown Austin. I would definitely stay here again and/or recommend it to friends. Amelia was helpful and communicative throughout. A great Austin home base."
44334720,989888948102170787,2023-09-27,248108144,Danny,Second time staying here and won’t be my last.
28640193,730607904,2021-02-12,9249841,Lauren,Lovely stay for a quick getaway!
23038138,1105864844828249653,2024-03-05,60605220,David,"Brian was very professional and proactive. Instructions were clear. He also offered suggestions for places to eat. So, he was a very approachable host and responsive. Most noteworthy: The apartment was spotless and VERY well appointed. <br/>We happened to arrive in town on Sunday late pm and stayed only 1 full day - not enough to really figure out the geography of Austin. So, while Brian’s place is near 6th East (we walked it once as it’s only a half mile or so) it’s not in a neighbourhood that you’d feel like strolling through, not much to see  in the immediate area. So, we found we needed a car to get around which was ok but we like walking places. Austin doesn’t seem like a highly walkable place. <br/>So, solid 5s for everything Brian did to make the experience very comfortable and 3 out of 5 for location as rated by folks who like to walk…a lot."
202187,1276945010581516374,2024-10-27,111290563,Kadie,John’s place was perfect for our long weekend in Austin. It’s private and homey and John and his wife were more than happy to help us if we needed anything at all. The kitties greeted us when we got to home and they were one of my favorite parts of our stay. The chickens were also awesome. The home is in walking distance to so many great spots in the S. Congress area and it was also easy to get an Uber to travel farther when needed. I would definitely recommend this home to anyone!
48951298,571809446817556879,2022-02-27,116551605,Katie,Andy was extremely responsive and accommodating. This Airbnb was perfect for our group of 6 and I’d certainly book again next time I’m in Austin!

23468465,511614334,2019-08-17,20629418,Juanita,"Our stay was wonderful! We were only in Austin for 1 night, however we felt at home in the space. Would definitely recommend an extended stay!"
1330518768754362603,1377647096697564565,2025-03-15,345562286,Taylor,"So good, I'll be staying there twice within a week! The animals were friendly and made minimal noise overnight, nothing a fellow pet owner can't handle. Better than the hotel I would use when visiting the area, as I am rarely in town long enough to justify the prices or take advantage of the amenities. This place is perfect for those stopping by and honestly just need a shower and a bed to sleep. The work desk within the bedroom was huge and put to good use during my stay. The space is comfortable for one person, would be more of a cozy fit for two people. Looking forward to staying again this week and in the future!"
501260614657629525,613074563155332754,2022-04-25,61734931,Jin,Austin’s place is very cozy and clean! It is well organized and decorated. <br/>And it is pretty close to everywhere. You can also find good restaurants and shopping nearby.

28640193,407973126437384894,2021-07-16,233993473,Eric,This was my first time in a tiny house. It was adorable. It had everything i could ask for plus plenty more. Loved it and will probably be back for a longer visit next time.
48867583,394854312293117670,2021-06-28,247686744,Bailey,Perfect hotel!!
1880094,414108596,2019-02-18,159006461,Chris,A nice apartment conveniently located with easy access to food and drinks in East Austin. Pretty easy to get into town as well.

Jenn was awesome and responsive and left great instructions.  I will definitely stay here again when I’m in the area. <br/>Thanks!
15942648,1017506969426984099,2023-11-04,327167333,Rheall,Stay was great! The location for me was beyond perfect for our 1 night in Austin since west 6th street was right there and walkable for a fun night out. Airbnb had everything the 2 of us could want. The only negative was the neighbors upstairs I'm pretty sure had Bevo over for a per game visit as the stomping started around 8am and was going strong when we left at 10am. But I've lived in many a downstairs units its just the nature of the beast so I just put on some TSwift and we jammed while getting ready and packing up.

15942648,452250066,2019-05-12,38402850,Audrey,"Nancy was as accommodating as I could possibly have wanted, communication was a breeze with her, and check-in was the easiest I've ever had on AirBnB! I think this place was a really good value because it's extremely clean, the proximity to downtown is close but not obnoxious, and the bed and pillows are ultra comfy! The Roku is a huge plus if you're there for a longer stay like we were. Would highly recommend for couples. The dimmers on all the lights are a nice touch."
12308357,149156379,2017-05-02,55496704,Ariel,"Beautiful getaway, true to description. Also, the pool is great and I *loved* the shower for those that are fans of a luxury shower experience. "

The central location allows for cheap ride-shares to other parts of the city, especially if staying during the week. Decor was cozy and reminiscent of the early 2010s hipster heyday. Quiet, leafy neighborhood. Highly recommend."
1880094,892117802490725300,2023-05-15,154309519,Melissa,Great place in a quiet Austin neighborhood. Lots of restaurants close by and it was an easy to get around to the popular tourist areas.  If you are able to bring bikes I would recommend as there is lots to do within a short bike ride and there were plenty of bike lanes/paths.

The surrounding area was very nice and quiet, and had a lot of walkable restaurants nearby.  The interior of the studio apartment looked just like the pictures, and had a pleasing, modern looking aesthetic to it.  Brian also was very helpful, and sent detailed instructions for everything before I arrived, so I didn’t need to ask many questions. Would highly recommend!"

I wish it had been better equipped for cooking and staying at the house as far as food storage and serving.<br/>The neighborhood was quiet and away from a lot of the noise of downtown.

The pool was “shared” but to be honest I never saw any other guess in it besides us. I’m definitely staying again. This was our first trip to Austin and this place alone made us want to return! Bill gave us privacy but let us know that he was there for anything that we needed! The Space was stylish and neat! Thank you Bill!

705858,427351115,2019-03-23,8350666,Brad,This studio is in a wonderful location and has what you need for a short stay.  We were in town for a wedding so it was perfect for us. The location is fantastic.  Very close to South Congress but also on a quiet and peaceful street.  Not really any private outdoor space as the courtyard is also the entrance to the other units.  Quite clean and comfortable.
733203,1403715766158279377,2025-04-20,189086036,Charlotte,"Location was great and the place is well suited for big groups. The only feedback I have is that some small functional things are missing - eg dressers to unpack clothes, not enough bright lighting, etc. It was overall a good home base for our group trip"
5094445,167425622,2017-07-06,75029284,Jessica,"Location, cleanliness, and decor are unmatched. Fair warning- there is no flexibility on the guest policy, but the rental is excellent and extremely well maintained. The pool was also pleasant. "
15886011,248065572,2018-03-30,81415879,Lisa,"Picture is accurate, save for the construction going up right outside the gorgeous view of the city. That did not deter, just something to be aware of. Most apt's in this location are Airbnb, save for 3 perm. residents. Very quiet, well appointed , but could use some female touches. Great clean, masculine place. It was perfect for what we needed and would rent again, when needed."

The airstream is comfortable and large enough for two people to move around freely. It has air-conditioning which cools the whole trailer down quickly.

Reminds me of the best of what Austin used to be. Very quiet house in the backyard. The place was very clean and had every extra you might need.

If I went back to Austin I would surely repeat in Bill's apartment!!"
202187,19427782,2014-09-12,1423994,Kristen,"We were only in John's backyard apartment for 24 hours, but it had all that we needed. <br/><br/>The location made it easy to have a late night, visit lots of food spots, and enjoy live music. <br/><br/>The space was tidy, though it does have a lived in feel. The bathroom is also very compact. The low showerhead was a little difficult for my husband to navigate, but he managed. <br/><br/>John was easy to communicate with, the bed was comfy, and access and check-out was very painless. "
949922,635557728818994410,2022-05-26,50310062,Monica,"Cannot say enough about this place!! Such a special little sanctuary tucked away and just a few minutes from downtown. The airstream was sooooo cute, clean, warm, ecclectic and inviting! Grab a glass of wine and relax outside under the light of the adorable twinkling lights or grab a cup of coffee and sit outside in the garden among the roosters that greet you! My favorite part was the cute little store that houses homemade jams, painted postcards and handcrafted goods made by Marcella and her kids, available to purchase as a cute little souvenir of your stay! We will be back!"

Chris also gave us some great recommendations for food and drinks! We were traveling with our puppy and we’re a little bummed when we realized the yard wasn’t fully enclosed, but it wasn’t a huge deal. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and it was a great first time in Austin!!"

The location is great—very safe neighborhood, nice walking trails, and close to lots of good restaurants, HEB, etc.<br/>The neighborhood is really quiet, but since it’s a garage apartment, there will be occasional noise from the attached house (mostly early mornings before school or when playing outside). We didn’t mind it, but noting it in case anyone doesn’t prefer such close proximity. <br/>The apartment was really comfortable and had mostly everything we needed for an extended stay! It was clean and had good storage space for our belongings (a major plus when you’re moving across the country). The host, Natalie, is super kind and was very responsive to any issues! We had a couple hiccups with the A/C unit in the bedroom, and Natalie was quick to get a tech out to fix it and answer any questions. <br/>We’d definitely stay here again!

It is 1 block from the Airbnb. <br/>Juan in a Million is a cute neighborhood restaurant with a wonderful breakfast.<br/>Jenny’s place was clean and the bed very comfortable."

I really believe his pours his heart into the SoCo cottage-making it into a home away from home for Austin visitors. I was honored to be his guest and felt safe at his properly! Very safe and respected. <br/><br/>I could not recommend this property enough. Truly, if you are in Austin or wanna visit, Chris had the best place for you! "

18326728,1279782193701338894,2024-10-31,42447691,Mary,"I absolutely loved staying in J.D.'s home - it was perfect.  It was spotlessly clean;  the bed was super comfortable; there was a huge walk-in wardrobe space; the bathroom was gleaming and spacious with towels/toiletries.  There were several chairs and desks one could use to work on if needed.  The wi-fi was super fast.  The flat was bright, comfortable and very welcoming. The access via a code was really efficient.  There was plenty of free parking in the  beautiful tree lined street.   There were lots of good coffee places close by for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  JD was extremely friendly on my arrival and showed me around.  He was also very respectful of my space and privacy upstairs - which I really appreciated.  If I had a question I knew that he was around - but I was able to come and go freely - as if it were my home.  I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this accommodation in Austin.  I hope to return in 18 months time and I will definitely re-book with J.D."
28253030,449974079579118449,2021-09-12,73705314,Amelia,"Clean, well decorated home. Walkable or a short drive to many local neighborhoods (LadyBird lake,  Rainey, Cesar Chavez). A convenient location for those who don't have a car in Austin as rentable bikes scooters and rideshare apps are easily accessible. The hosts were friendly helpful and professional. Their new kittens are cute and their dog was a love bug! You get the entire upstairs area but I felt very welcome downstairs as well. They even brought us migas breakfast tacos on our last morning! I would recommend to friends and stay there again if I were to return to Austin"

Right when you walk in, the house offers an unique space and decor. The place is very hip, modern and welcoming. The neighborhood is quiet, but we never had a problem regarding noise complaints. "

44334720,661596341,2020-09-07,365684880,Connor,"Pros: lovely, spacious unit with enough amenities to make it feel like home. The location was right in the center of the city which meant picking up food was a few minutes of walking. We also really appreciated the television in the bedroom (there's another TV in the living room). Great value for the price. <br/>Cons: the response time for questions was a bit lacking at times. White walls and concrete (?) floors with a few scuff marks here and there."

It was a short drive to a good selection of stores, restaurants, and multiple parks.  Additionally, it was only about a 5-minute drive to the light rail station which we found to be a great way to commute to downtown and avoid the highway traffic."

The place itself is small--a loft studio--but very cozy and fits two just fine. Great bed, more than adequate kitchen. Check-in and parking were easy, and Bill was extremely responsive when we had a minor issue with the shower. "

The house had everything we needed and then extra things we forgot (like a lint roller). It was super quiet and our kids loved the place. We would definitely stay here again.

Between my wife and I, we tend to book stays in different cities based on convenience or aesthetic. I will say we got the best of both worlds in Julie's place. As soon as you walk in and flip on the light switch, you're met with uniqueness with guitars on the walls, paintings and pictures that highlight world travels, or even just highlighting Austin in its own unique way. Each room, from the outdoor deck, TV room, kitchen, bedroom, loft, and bathroom, had their own unique flavor. Almost like stepping into a new world each time. As for convenience, we were able to easily walk less than a mile in any direction and found great coffee(Desnudo) and Amazing Breakfast(Rockstar Bagels). We took advantage of the anemities as we got to enjoy the Infrared Sauna, and had it not been in the upper 20s, i would have gladly taken up that Cold Plunge as well. Overall a fantastic stay, will have to come back soon."

32696235,1131971519853985362,2024-04-10,55014568,Nathan,"My stay here for the week was great. the location is backed up against the lake so it feels very private. Pool and hot tub are another added bonus. The place was clean upon arrival and the hosts were responsive. They even stocked the fridge with drinks which was greatly appreciated after a long travel day. The location itself is also super walkable to bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and 6th Street. Added bonus, they charge a cleaning fee but don't ask you to do any ""pre cleaning"" like a lot of places do these days. Reminded me how air BnB used to be, 10/10 would stay again."

The unit has a kind of loft layout with the bedroom and master bath upstairs (there's also  very nice half-bath downstairs).  There is an oak tree right outside the bedroom window, and it's just a terrific view.   Great bedroom, and the bath is large and the shower is great.<br/>The kitchen is huge and well kitted.   Granite countertops, modern appliances, gas range, a quiet dishwasher, and the lighting is terrific.   Lots of space, and there's even a kitchen table that seats 4 comfortably.   The same oak tree visible from the bedroom is just outside the kitchen window.   The greenery outside both rooms is  just beautiful.  <br/>The TV has a good soundbar below it, much appreciated.  Check-in was super easy.  Front door is super secure.  <br/>This place is a jewel.   I really enjoyed my stay."

Easy check-in/check-out, location right in the center of everything, nice gym, pool looked good (didn't use, too cold outside).  Not going to get the friendly personal touches, but doesn't get any easier for a quick stay.  Super large unit, nice big kitchen with dishwasher, large refrigerator, and full-size washer/dryer.  A perfect unit for a quick trip or an extended stay.    Surrounding area is great.  Safe, no concerns at all.  Would rent again in a heart beat."

53861695,546336490891121333,2022-01-23,338682985,Talia,This place was great! The hosts were welcoming and the unit had everything you'd ever need and more! We're staying here every time we come down to visit. I'm jealous that my bed isn't as comfortable as the one they have and that my water doesn't get as hot! Super close to many restaurants and things to do!
29302404,677488005006265708,2022-07-23,125161573,Julia,"Sean and Bronwyne were extremely accommodating and friendly, let us check in early. very clean and well appointed with anything we might need. Very comfortable and great location near great restaraunts and nightlife. Short 10 min from downtown"
45221683,841361210312409776,2023-03-06,118120992,Sally,This house was in the perfect location for us and easily housed me and three of my coworkers.  We all had a separate space and enough privacy.  I hope to stay here again next year!
44334720,1060277367751190383,2024-01-02,105592673,Gregorio,"Buen alojamiento, cómodo y bien ubicado, limpio y agradable. El acceso al estacionamiento que pague previamente no se encontró a nuestra llegada, después de varias comunicaciones y algo de tiempo nos entregaron pegantinas adheribles a los ticket de estacionamiento que solucionaron el problema, también a nuestra llegada encontramos una lámpara de mesa que tenía mal funcionamiento y en el exterior del alojamiento había una luz de emergencia que emitía un sonido irritante que aunque no se escuchaba desde el interior del alojamiento era molesto en el pasillo exterior. Creo que corrigiendo esos detalles el alojamiento será muy bueno."
2528473,1263946863878919692,2024-10-09,135948096,Kathy,"Enjoyed staying in the garden cottage.  The yard is naturally pretty with local plants in abundance, string lights at night and cute buildings.  Enjoyed feeding the pigs, ducks and chickens and meeting the new pup.  Marcella was friendly, greeted me and gave me space.  <br/>The cottage is well decorated, was clean and had a small fridge and microwave along with coffee and coffee pot.  Bed was comfortable."
1462311,120314218,2016-12-09,43509360,Donna,"Chris is a great host, gave me tips on best food, how to get to my meeting and how to maneuver through Austin"
15886011,458675658665689551,2021-09-24,23624993,Courtney,"Let me start by saying that i’ve never left a bad review for an airbnb and this is my 3rd Airbnb just this week - but this Airbnb just did not fit the bill. The cleanliness was sub-par in which I had mentioned to the host. The $104 cleaning fee doesn’t seem to be being utilized in the space as almost all the pans were dirty when we went to use them, shower curtain soiled, as well as dirt and grime just in various places throughout the space. We went to watch Netflix and it said too many people were using the account already so we couldn’t utilize that feature. The water/ice maker on the fridge didn’t work either. The full length mirrors aren’t in the space at all. And the area the condo is in is a bit rough. Although Whole Foods was just around the corner which was a nice perk. <br/>I was super excited to find this spot even for an evening as my mom had just flown into Austin - but it was an incredibly underwhelming experience. The condo has definitely seen a lot of wear on every corner which isn’t evident in the photos posted. All in all, it did the job for a place to stay. Just wouldn’t be my first choice in Austin."
12308357,441182294,2019-04-21,191425516,Rafael,A wonderful stay at Bill’s. I’ll definitely consider going back one day.

The private entrance to her yard was simple and unobtrusive, which was perfect for my hectic schedule during the week while I was there. I've already recommended this retro paradise to friends, and I will continue to do so. Thanks Marcella!"

We came back as a family to visit friends and our favorite spots and it was just the perfect spot for us. Great location in Bouldin Creek and the house is well set up, clean, and comfortable. Highly recommend for someone looking to stay in a comfortable space in Austin in a great neighborhood close to lots of stuff!"

51106805,1028354186791637329,2023-11-19,354123632,Samantha,"This was the first airbnb that was SUPER CLEAN. I clean houses during the week and I noticed even the baseboards were so clean. So I knew she dusted. She’s amazing, I was checking in pretty late and told her about it and she was on it. Communication skills A1 perfection. Even had a tv in the room to feel at home. I usually am the type of guest to keep to myself and not use a kitchen and whatnot so she even respected my privacy was not one of those hosts that comes barging in and introduces themselves. I’d definitely come back here anytime. I loved that she had cameras everywhere outside for peace of mind upon my vehicle. JANICE YOU’RE AMAZING!"
11439003,1018163614194480331,2023-11-05,531921782,Gerritt,"Alice offers a welcoming environment to come and relax in. There’s a bunch of amenities and things to do, including a set of instructions/ space to build your own fire! Beds weee comfy, a lot of extra items were available like hair ties, cokes, coffee, spray deodorant- things you could easily forget at home. Location is close to many of the great sites of interest in Austin. Alice is responsive and quick to help with any issues. Would love to stay here again, highly recommend!"

48867583,1358082220383876178,2025-02-16,326549250,Lauren,We had an incredible time staying here. The hotel was in a great location and the staff were super friendly. When we told the front desk that this was our first time traveling to Austin they gave us a list of all the places they recommended. We also got lucky and were able to check in early. The beds were extremely comfortable and the room was more spacious than expected. We had an amazing time and would stay here again when traveling to Austin.
1462311,841376119065175429,2023-03-06,28071554,Rachel,"Chris’s place was in the perfect location for this Austin first-timer - just off South Congress and South 1st, a scooter or Uber ride away from downtown. We went to the cafe at the corner the first two mornings we were there (amazing breakfast tacos and coffee) and Chris was full of recs for everything we needed. The house itself is awesome, super comfortable, cozy, and the goat and horses that came by were a bonus. Felt right at home. Would definitely stay here again!"

202187,68793004,2016-04-06,41002229,Katherine,We spent two nights in Austin.  The cottage was private and comfortable and John was helpful. The location is terrific. We walked to the Capitol and the Driscoll Hotel. We also enjoyed watching their hens walking around. We would stay there again.
1462311,84503734,2016-07-07,46289964,Sharon,"The SoCo Cottage was comfortable and conveniently located.  The bed was quite comfortable and the place nicely equipped with everything we needed.  We enjoyed relaxing with our coffee in the morning and wine in the evenings.  There was a peaceful water fountain outside which could be one of the reasons we slept so well.  Chris is very knowledgeable about the area and restaurants.  We had some plans, but also went to a few of the restaurants that he suggested.  They were all within walking distance and excellent!  We are ""foodies"" so that is really saying a lot!  Chris was very accommodating and never more than a text or phone call away.  We had a car, so we didn't use any of the car services available but they did seem very popular in the area.  We enjoyed meeting his well behaved dogs which made us miss ours a little less! "
12308357,354368738,2018-12-01,10105611,Marina,This suite is gorgeous! A five star experience all the way around. You will be delighted with Bill's sense of style and amazing design touches that will make your stay so comfortable!
1880094,362927727,2018-12-27,31475770,Nancy,The apt was a pleasant place to stay. The bed was really comfortable.   We both slept well. We  stayed over  Christmas break and found the apt quiet for sleeping.  The kitchen had all we needed for cooking and the bathroom was very clean.  The apt has several windows so it is quite bright. Overall it was a very relaxing place to stay. <br/>It is also centrally located between the lake and the east side eateries.  We found everything we needed within walking distance. Of course several Uber and Lyft drivers cruise the area if you want to go farther afield.

The accommodation was just as described with incredibly comfortable beds and clean amenities. The neighbourhood was quiet and we utilised Ubers to get around town to the spots Korynn recommended. Definitely a great airbnb experience and can highly recommend Korynn as a host. <br/>Thanks for helping to  make our trip to Austin a memorable one.
53413902,1203704840915201024,2024-07-18,18114473,Scott,"Nice place, but it needs some lawn work to cut back on the inserts hanging around - inside and out.  Very good location.  Host shamelessly looks to nickel and dime you with early and late checkout fees, etc.  Specifically, within hours of moving out, a package arrived for us.  We told the cleaning crew we would swing by to get it in the afternoon.  When we did, it was gone, and in order to retrieve the package, we were told we had to open an account with a third-party website, pay an initiation fee, and another fee per package to ship.  Given that we're locals, we cut through the BS and picked up the package ourselves."

It was very easy to find, and I had no trouble at all with checking in or out. They were very easy to communicate with. I had everything I needed right there in the space.

15942648,481832845162258741,2021-10-26,118214092,Kathy,We enjoyed our stay at Nancy And Vins place. They were extremely responsive to any questions and messages I sent. The location is perfect. We enjoyed being near local cafes to get coffee and breakfast each morning. As others have noted you do hear the outside noises and neighbors above but to us this is just what comes with staying in a city and didn't detract from our stay.
23468465,242615411,2018-03-12,41468816,Matthew,This is truly a little oasis. Amazing space which reflects Austin’s charm. Julie and Pete were welcoming and gracious hosts.

From the time we arrived little Reggie the cat was more than happy to escort us to our front door which was so cute! Loved the little mini neighborhood feel of the backyard - a little mercantile shop for treats during your stay, all of the other animals on site, and the strings of lights which guided your way home if you were coming home late from dinner or in town after sunset. Would highly recommend staying and would love to get the chance to meet Marcella next time. Her story and little family album in the AirBnB were the perfect touch."

1462311,671909273,2020-10-06,17797016,Analily,"My boyfriend and I had the most amazing stay at Chris’s cottage! This was our first time visiting Austin and we couldn’t have chosen a better place to stay! First of all, the location is PERFECT. You can easily walk to downtown and not only that, but to get there, you walk down the coolest street full of boutiques, coffee shops, ice cream, and restaurants. The cottage is located in South Congress which is a neighborhood with a lot of character and charm and the weirdness you hope to find in Austin. Also, if you’re a Triple D fan, you have Home Slice, Inside Out, and Magnolia Bakery within a short walk! There is also a cupcake place around the corner that won Cupcake Wars. How cool is that? Secondly, the cottage is immaculate! It looks just like the pictures and you can tell a lot of thought went into decorating it. I can’t forget Pumpkin!! This little goat stole my heart! He is so precious!!!Finally, but most importantly, Chris is the friendliest host ever! He is very welcoming and will give you great recommendations! You can tell he loves Austin and wants you to have a great time! This place is a gem! You will love staying here!!"

I came into town for a concert so I was not around very much, but I had my own wing of the house to myself (a bedroom and private bathroom). The house was very neat and nicely decorated, and their dog Mari was cute as a button (she wears a little barrette in her hair!).

The location is fantastic, including private parking, and the accommodations were perfect for our relaxing weekend getaway.

One of our favorite amenities of the Casita is that it is walking distance of one of our favorite spots, Quacks. <br/>High marks for this gem!"

The house is exactly like the pictures, the bed was very comfortable, and the place was clean when we arrived.  The space heater came in handy as it got cold during the night.

So many things in walking distance and to bus where we took advantage of a weekly bus pass. The pass got us to/from the airport, a visit to South Congress for shopping/music/food, The 04 Center for a show and to the Bullock Museum. We didn’t experience issues with construction noise, that others have mentioned. We did wish there was a cookie sheet or pizza pan or at least some aluminum foil for a frozen pizza on our one night in, otherwise the kitchen was functional. The TV in the bedroom worked but the TV in the living room wasn’t connected to internet so didn’t work for us to access our own viewing apps such as Netflix. We didn’t ask for assistance because we weren’t planning on much TV time anyway."

23468465,788461750000178384,2022-12-23,62458211,Lulu,This place was such a cute and quirky home! The home decor and all the little touches were so my style. The location is perfect very close to everything. The only negative experience I had was the hot water running out. But I honestly think it was due to the ice storm that occurred during my stay. We accidentally lost the key during our Austin adventures and Julie was very quick to respond. I really appreciated that because it was 17° outside! 10 out of 10 would recommend!
28253030,563343188,2019-11-12,238385948,Gloria,Charming space in a beautiful home. Shawn and Saundra were super friendly and welcoming.  Great location close to downtown as well as east side restaurants and bars.
2528473,532405561,2019-09-19,22335695,Maddeysen,Marcella’s place was a quiet escape in Austin. We loved seeing the foliage and animals on our way to the cottage. Marcella was friendly and kind and had recommendations as it was our first time to the area.
10042925,236631372,2018-02-19,133449186,Wendy,"Absolutely beautiful house, with 3 very comfy bedrooms. The kitchen, living room and dining room were very nicely done. And loved the Keurig!"

949922,11644322,2014-04-10,11312108,Samantha,"So cute - pretty much exactly what the pictures show, and better. Stayed here with a friend, we were cozy despite the chilly nights. And we made friends with cats, chickens, dogs and a pig! It was a really nice spot to come back to and rest midday, as well. Pretty easy access from generally anywhere we were in Austin."
959328438288766178,1334250483713411229,2025-01-14,166438122,Lillian,"Robin‘s place is very clean, very comfortable, and very fresh. The location can’t be beat. I really liked that,  even though it was well decorated, there was plenty of room for us to put our things. Especially convenient where the cubbyholes in the bedrooms. Next time we come to Austin, we’ll try to get the same place!"
240541,257072355,2018-04-24,55098811,Liam,"Elizabeth's place was great! It was about a 40 minute walk.into Austin, near some.absolutely great food, and bars! <br/>The place itself is pretty good, it could do with a lick of paint here and there but is a great spot to put your head for a couple of nights!"
2528473,769931707,2021-06-13,118522745,Shelby,"Just as described. I wasn't able to see Daisy or Shiner. Maybe they were hiding from the heat! The cottage was perfect, though."
2528473,37307083,2015-07-06,19473214,Andrew,"Fun......Close to the City of Austin, TX and the Airport........Full of Life with Chickens, a Dog, a Pig, a Cat, and their Lovely Children. The Essence of Austin, TX was shown in both the Garden Cottage and within the Hosts."
705858,458613335498191760,2021-09-24,81204,Ruby,"Absolutely loved my stay here. The salt water pool was relaxing, the bed was comfortable, with restaurants and bars just a short walk away. Looking forward to coming back next time."

We had a lovely stay aside from the expensive late checkout fee. They were very neglectful to allow a free late checkout even though there was no guest coming in that day."
1462311,240647958,2018-03-05,129635204,Leia,"This is a comfortable, private place to stay in a wonderful neighborhood. The goats and sweet pups are a delightful addition to the experience."

There is a heater and AC unit to regulate temperature, great WiFi, a lovely patio space (where the WiFi works), TV with movies, and functional kitchen. Drew and Danny were great hosts who ensured to satisfy our every need as guests. Highly recommended!"

5094445,62342936,2016-02-14,23412439,Shannon,"The Hideaway was an all around lovely experience! The photos and descriptions of the space are completely spot on and we loved the location -- just a short (and enjoyable) walk to everything that South Congress has to offer. The proximity to the trails of Little and Big Stacy Park was an added bonus for the runner in me!<br/><br/>Our flights in and out of Austin were outside the check-in and check-out time, but Bill was kind enough to allow us to stash our bags for a few hours on either end of the trip. His willingness to accommodate was obvious and greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>The Hideaway is a must-stay and we hope our travels will bring us back to Austin sometime soon.<br/><br/>(And the pool! I can't forget about the pool! It made an amazing stay and even better!)"

17590487,359936389,2018-12-18,65668095,Jeff,"Great location! Downtown is an 8 minute drive away, and not a bad walk if the weather is nice."
23038138,1505235704078864759,2025-09-07,229127477,Rafael,Great place to stay in Austin. We came for an event at COTA. It was close to downtown with great access to outside the city towards COTA. It was clean and matched the description! I’d stay here again.

46485666,432646167384150721,2021-08-19,5151395,Maggie,"Dishonest host, kasa tried to collect my credit card information several times after the booking was already confirmed. Then due to an apparent “tech glitch” on their part, I couldn’t check into my unit until 6 hours after  my confirmed check-in time, kasa rep on phone said there was no way to let me cancel, basically they took zero accountability for any of their errors so I spent many hours on the phone today to finally get refunded."
43547536,759325228,2021-05-16,93920621,Alyssa,The house is stunning! And the host was extremely prompt at responding to any questions.We loved our stay here.11/10 recommend!!

7859914,116327575,2016-11-29,24881348,Lynn,"Joshua and Tiffany were super easy to communicate with. The space is set up very nicely with a lot of extra touches like travel information, breakfast bars, and coffee. It was the perfect place for our early flight out of the airport (less than 15 minutes away). We just had two people, but the space was set up very nicely for a family. I would recommend.  "
2528473,27426505,2015-03-04,23638309,Jenny Koleene,"My husband and I stayed at this sweet little cottage for our late honeymoon, and it was the best little home away from home we could ask for. Despite the dreary weather outside, we stayed nice and cozy the whole time. Marcella is such a wonderful host, and she has such a darling family. Next time we're in Austin, we have plans to stay here again!"

2528473,55348417,2015-12-01,33930240,Heather,Everything was as described. We had contact with Marcella through text as we arrived late. Everything was nice and cozy. We did not have any issues.
686893963514622006,1145798729576321694,2024-04-29,131903158,Ryan,"Beautiful Airbnb, looks exactly like the pictures! We had a wonderful time there. Located in a quiet/peaceful area as well. The place was spotless, tons of amenities, very comfortable. We had some issues with the hot tub initially but Gary was very responsive and offered solutions that we were able to work together on to fix the issue promptly.<br/>Would definitely stay here again!"
705858,218431737,2017-12-12,83405822,Leigh Anne,"This is the perfect place for two, especially if you want to enjoy all the cool things in south Austin: great restaurants, coffee, and shopping on SOCO, all the food trucks on south 1st, and a great park within walking distance. Bill's place was bright, cheerful, clean and so comfortable. Best bed ever. We loved it!"
949922,4983557,2013-06-05,6170501,Elizabeth,"What an amazing time! My husband and I stayed in Marcella's Airstream for 4 nights when visiting Austin and it was perfect! Clean, well laid-out, and comfy, the Airstream made a great base for our travels. The location is right by the bus, too, so it is really easy to get downtown. Marcella was wonderful! Very helpful and friendly. And she makes awesome toffee :)."
57187,17594892,2014-08-14,19541246,Vy,"We totally fell in love with the place! It was tidy and clean. Lois was a very good host.

The downsides are that Kasa has a completely separate check in account and process from AirBNB which was cumbersome. In addition, the bathroom had a filthy shower curtain protector."

949922,644348998,2020-07-30,157187370,Melissa,Super cute space! <br/>Would recommend staying here in the cooler months. With outside temp being almost 100 degrees the window unit was reading 78 degrees majority of the stay.

Very thoughtful touches inside with dressing gowns, toothbrushes, toothpaste etc. The location was great- only a 10-15 walk to SoCo where there are loads of restaurants, bars and shops. We bumped into Bill shortly after checking in and had a chat- such a lovely guy. I really wish we had stayed in Austin longer in this place- next time!"

18326728,152311414,2017-05-15,128794983,Camille,"From check in to check out, staying in J.D.'s home was comfortable and convenient. Having the entire upstairs to myself made it feel quiet and private, and the location of his home makes it easy to get across Austin. J.D. is hospitable and friendly. He made sure I had everything I needed: espresso in the morning to fresh towels, access to wifi/netflix, and neighborhood restaurant recommendations. All of this amounted to great experience!"
5873238,741313059003379736,2022-10-19,35710577,Nicholas,"Basics are good. Location, comfort all good in a peaceful location. The kitchen is equipped to a bare minimum level and it wouldn’t be easy to fully self cater. We were missing quite a few basic items like soap, garbage bags, dishwashing basics and cooking pots. This was an issue with a new cleaning firm. Chris did correct this quickly but he probably should have supervised a new cleaning firm more closely. An OK Airbnb that could be great with a bit more investment."
5873238,953743050517560326,2023-08-08,237781073,Breanna,This little place is perfect for what is needed for a traveling duo or single! Cute area with lots to eat/do readily available or a quick drive away. Bonus that even in a heat wave this little gem managed to stay comfortable and cold the entire time.

956708,3799203,2013-03-16,2523635,Yanni,"Great apartment, close enough to downtown that it isn't a total mission to get to and far away to have some solace from the city."
949922,9702308,2014-01-06,2462667,Whitney,My partner and I were looking for a relaxing vacation and an opportunity to explore Austin for the first time.  We absolutely loved the airstream!!  It was comfortable and beautifully decorated.  The backyard garden space is beautiful! And we couldn't get enough of Fern (the pig). Marcella is a fantastic host! We were hoping for slow days and relaxation.  Marcella gave us the space that we needed while providing comfort and useful recommendations when we asked!  OH and her family is lovely and the toffee is great!
